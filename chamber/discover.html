            <h2>Exploring Hartsville</h2>
            <h3>History of Hartsville</h3>
            <p>Hartsville traces its origins to Thomas Edward Hart, who came to the area in 1817 and built a plantation 
                along Black Creek. His son, John Lide Hart, developed Hartsville Plantation in what is now downtown, 
                creating a carriage factory, steam-powered sawmill, grist mill and more.</p>
            <p>Early community leader James Lide Coker played an extremely influential role in Hartsville’s development. 
                He and his family would develop a seed company, oil mill, fertilizer plant and the iconic J.L. Coker & 
                Company General Store, housed in a massive brick storefront which remains a downtown landmark. The Cokers 
                also created Welsh Neck High School, the forerunner of Coker University, as well as the Southern Novelty 
                Company, the predecessor to Sonoco Products Company, a major provider of packaging, industrial products and 
                more. Hartsville received its town charter on Dec. 11, 1891, in a period of growing industry, business, and a 
                booming population.</p>
            <h3>Hartville Today</h3>
            <p>We are Hartsville, South Carolina, and we are one of the most dynamic small towns in the South.</p>
            <p>We are a place where business and industry thrive. We are one of the smallest cities in America 
                to be the headquarters of a Fortune 500 company. Our businesses compete and thrive on a state level 
                and a global stage. From multi-national corporations to locally-owned upstarts, we have nurtured a 
                culture that fuels ingenuity and innovation throughout our community.</p>
            <p>Hartsville is today a center of industry, education, and reinvention – the South Carolina Governor’s 
                School for Science and Mathematics, for example, has been built on the site of the Hartsville Cotton 
                Mill. Possessing a downtown full of historic sites, access to Prestwood Lake and an ongoing array of 
                quality-of-life projects from recreational facilities, special events and community development opportunities, 
                Hartsville remains a small town full of innovation and opportunity.</p>
